Functionality

The user will be able to click onto a screen and view the data for tables and stats.When they go to the donate screen they can pick which method they wish to send money via paypal of debit. They can also pick which team they want to send the money too. Users can also manually input amounts as the number picker will only go up to one thousand. When all this has been decided they can press the donate button and the amount will go through.
They can then go to the report screen and check which donations they have made.
Users can also register in this app. They just need to go to the register screen and input an Email, Username and Password and they will be registered.
When users comeback to the app they can login as they have already registered, they go to the login screen and input the email address and password they used for registering.

Persistence

The persistence in this app can be seen in the login and register screen as it will remember your account details. You can also see it in the report screen as it remembers the donations you made even if you go from one page to the next.

UX/DX

In this app I decided to use a menu you access by pressing the elipse on the top right of a screen and you can go anywhere in the app from there. The elipse is on every screen of the app.

For DX I used one model class and this was used for the donation class. I also uploaded the project onto github.
